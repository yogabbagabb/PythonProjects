# PythonProjects

This folder contains some modules that I wrote to learn how to perform useful scientific computing operations in python.

It also contains a folder (OperationsA) with modules used in the 2016 MCM contest, in which a partner and I tried to simulate
message dissemination through a facebook friend network that we represented using an adjacency array.

If I ever decide to return to Python to learn how to use data structures in the language (improbable), this folder will feature that learning.
